# nodenet
A node-based asynchronous event-driven networking library for python.

**This is still a work in progress. Read the TODO section.**

## 'node-based'?
(No, I don't mean [node.js](http://nodejs.org).)

nodenet is centered around **nodes** rather than clients and servers. Each node is bound to a port and can connect to an arbitrary number of other nodes. The network itself is built on top of TCP (although I will probably move it to UDP in the near future).

## TODO
- docs
- docs
- more docs
- lots of tests
- make a setup.py and publish the module
- move to UDP
